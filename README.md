## How Java Programs works ? 
1. how java program works basic execution [steps](https://www.javatpoint.com/internal-details-of-hello-java-program), _(here the intepretor is also known as JIT ( just in time compiler ))_.
2. compilation and execution of java program [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compilation-execution-java-program/).
3. java platform [independent](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-platform-independent/). 

## basic rules
1. why single public class and significance of main method ? [here](https://dzone.com/articles/why-single-java-source-file-can-not-have-more-than). 

## OOPS

1. four main pillars of loops ie **abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance**. for more [info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/four-main-object-oriented-programming-concepts-of-java/)

### Abstraction

1. **Abstraction** means, hiding the internal details of the method, in java it is achieved by 2 methods ie , _abstract_ class and _interfaces_. for more [info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-classes-in-java/)

2. Abstraction Examples
   1. example of 100% Abstraction achieved through abstract keyword. [here](/abstraction/Examples.md).
   2. abstract method declaration with parameters [here](/abstraction/parametrised-abstract-method.md).
   3. when to use abstract class vs interface [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/when-to-use-an-abstract-class-and-when-to-use-an-interface-in-java).
   4. abstract class vs interface differen [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/).
